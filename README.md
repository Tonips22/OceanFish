## Main Ideas
Initially, our goal was to develop a **Vulkan** project where a **3D fish** could be observed and interacted with using the keyboard and mouse. However, due to various factors such as the **available time** for completion and the **technical complexity** it posed for us, we decided to shift our approach and opt for a **Blender animation**.

This decision allowed us to focus on creating a visually appealing environment and achieving realistic fish animation in its aquatic habitat, thus maintaining the essence of our initial idea but with a more accessible and achievable approach within the project's timeframe.

## Project Description
This project consists of a **Blender animation** of a fish swimming in an underwater environment. Blender's suite of tools was used to animate, and render the scene.

The main features of the animation include:
- **3D Fish modeling** using references from Sketchfab.
- **Texturing and shading** to give it a realistic appearance.
- **Rigging and animation** to generate smooth swimming motion.
- **Lighting and visual effects** to simulate the aquatic environment.
- **Final rendering** as a high-quality video.

The final result is a video showcasing the fish animation in its underwater setting with light and shadow effects.

## Directory Structure
The project structure is organized as follows:

```
OceanFish/
│── assets/                 # Resources used in the project
│   ├── models/             # Downloaded or created 3D models
│   ├── textures/           # Texture images
│── public/                 # Images and videos of the development process
│── video/                  # Rendered animation video
│── README.md               # Project explanatory document
```

Since GitHub does not allow uploading files larger than **100MB**, the final Blender project file (**project.blend**) is available for download via the following link:

➡️ [Download project.blend and TEST.mp4 (high quality) from Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1koPH4MW0Ttxk_jMB0YJTv8PE4AmkTLAn?usp=sharing)

This structure allows for clear file organization, separating **models**, **textures**, **development assets**, and **rendered video**, making navigation and content reuse easier.
